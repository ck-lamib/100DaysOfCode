//Path_constants will help make constants for the path in assets. (It can also be added during the project). What are paths? These are the ways we use to access a certain image or icon. First, we need to get to the assets folder, then the images or icons folder, and only then can we reach the very file. We have a separate path for each of the onboarding pages.

class PathConstants {
  // Onboarding
  static const String onboarding1 = 'assets/images/onboarding/onboarding.png';
  static const String onboarding2 = 'assets/images/onboarding/onboarding_2.png';
  static const String onboarding3 = 'assets/images/onboarding/onboarding_3.png';
}
